# Avatar

Welcome to the documentation for the "Avatar" component in the Baka UI Library. The "Avatar" component is used to represent a user's profile image or initials in a compact, visually appealing manner.

## Introduction

The "Avatar" component is a versatile element that can be used to display user profile images, initials, or icons. It's a crucial part of creating user-friendly interfaces, providing visual context to user identities.

### Usage

To use the "Avatar" component, import it from `@baka/react` and include it in your JSX code. Here's a basic example:

```jsx
import { BakaAvatar } from "@baka/react";

// Inside your component:
<BakaAvatar>A</BakaAvatar>
```

### Variants

The "Avatar" component can be customized in various ways:

- **BakaIcon Avatar**: You can place an icon or any content inside the "Avatar" component to represent the user.

```jsx
<BakaAvatar>
  <BakaIcon>check</BakaIcon>
</BakaAvatar>
```

- **Text Avatar**: You can use initials or any text to create a simple text-based avatar.

```jsx
<BakaAvatar>A</BakaAvatar>
```

- **Image Avatar**: If you have user profile images, you can use an image as the avatar.

```jsx
<BakaAvatar>
  <BakaIcon as="img" src="/avatar.svg" />
</BakaAvatar>
```

### Usage Guidelines

When using the "Avatar" component, consider the following guidelines:

- **BakaIcon Avatars**: These are suitable for representing actions or states associated with the user. For example, you can use a checkmark icon to indicate a verified user.

```jsx
<BakaAvatar>
  <BakaIcon>check</BakaIcon>
</BakaAvatar>
```

- **Text Avatars**: Use text avatars when you want a simple and clean representation of the user, such as displaying their initials.

```jsx
<BakaAvatar>A</BakaAvatar>
```

- **Image Avatars**: When you have user profile images, use image avatars to provide a visual representation of the user.

```jsx
<BakaAvatar>
  <BakaIcon as="img" src="/avatar.svg" />
</BakaAvatar>
```

## Real-World Examples
