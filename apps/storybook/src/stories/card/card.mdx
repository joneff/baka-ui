# Card Component

The Card component is a versatile component for displaying content with a consistent and visually appealing design. It can be customized with different variants to match the style of your application.

## Usage

To use the Card component, import it from `@baka/react`:

```tsx
import { BakaCard } from "@baka/react";
```

Then, you can create a Card with different variants and content as needed.

```tsx
<BakaCard variant={"outlined"}>
  {/* Content goes here */}
</BakaCard>
```

### Variants

The Card component supports the following variants:

- `"outlined"`: A card with an outlined border.
- `"elevated"`: A card with elevated (raised) appearance.
- `"filled"`: A card with a filled background color.

You can also combine variants to create unique card styles, such as `"["outlined", "horizontal"]"` for an outlined horizontal card.

## Content

The content of a Card can be customized based on your needs. You can include text, images, buttons, and other components within the Card to display your content effectively.

### Example

Here's an example of how to create a Card with some content:

```tsx
<BakaCard variant={"outlined"} style={{ width: 360 }}>
  <div>
    {/* Your content goes here */}
  </div>
</BakaCard>
```

## Examples

### Basic Card

```tsx
<BakaCard variant={"outlined"} style={{ width: 360 }}>
  {/* Your content goes here */}
</BakaCard>
```

### Elevated Card

An elevated Card with filled variant:

```tsx
<BakaCard variant={"elevated"} style={{ width: 360 }}>
  {/* Your content goes here */}
</BakaCard>
```

### Horizontal Card

A horizontal Card with filled variant:

```tsx
<BakaCard variant={["filled", "horizontal"]} style={{ width: 360 }}>
  {/* Your content goes here */}
</BakaCard>
```

## Props
