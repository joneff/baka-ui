# Switch

The Switch component allows users to toggle between two states: on and off. It is a common UI element used for binary choices.

## Installation

To use the Switch component in your project, make sure you have the `@baka/react` package installed. You can install it using npm or yarn:

```bash
npm install @baka/react
```

or

```bash
yarn add @baka/react
```

## Usage

Import the `BakaSwitch` component from `@baka/react` in your JavaScript or TypeScript file.

```jsx
import { BakaSwitch } from "@baka/react";
```

### Basic Usage

```jsx
<BakaSwitch checked={true} />
```

### Variants

The Switch component comes in two variants: default and icon.

#### Default Variant

The default variant of the Switch is used for simple binary choices.

```jsx
<BakaSwitch  />
```

#### BakaIcon Variant

The icon variant of the Switch is used when you want to represent the on and off states with icons.

```jsx
<BakaSwitch variant={"icon"} />
```

### States

The Switch component supports several states, including hovered, focused, activated, and disabled.

#### Hovered

```jsx
<BakaSwitch hovered={true} />
```

#### Focused

```jsx
<BakaSwitch focused={true} />
```

#### Activated

```jsx
<BakaSwitch activated={true} />
```

#### Disabled

```jsx
<BakaSwitch disabled={true} />
```

### Controlled vs. Uncontrolled

The `BakaSwitch` component can be used in controlled or uncontrolled mode. In controlled mode, you provide the `checked` prop to specify the state of the switch. In uncontrolled mode, you omit the `checked` prop, and the component manages its state internally.

### Events

The Switch component does not emit any custom events. You can handle changes in its state by listening to the `onChange` event if you are using it in a controlled mode.

```jsx
<BakaSwitch onChange={(event) => console.log(event.target.checked)} />
```
