# Button

Welcome to the documentation for the "Button" component in the Baka UI Library. The "Button" component is a fundamental building block for user interactions in your web applications. It offers various styles and states to cater to different use cases.

## Introduction

The "Button" component in Baka UI provides a versatile set of button styles, allowing you to choose the right appearance for your application. Whether you need a filled, outlined, text, elevated, tonal, or a Floating Action Button (FAB), this component has you covered.

### Usage

To use the "Button" component, import it from `@baka/react` and include it in your JSX code. Here's a basic example:

```jsx
import { BakaButton } from "@baka/react";

// Inside your component:
<BakaButton>Click Me</BakaButton>
```

### Variants

| Variant  | Description                          |
|----------|--------------------------------------|
| Filled   | Solid background, suitable for primary actions. |
| Outlined | Transparent background with a visible border, great for secondary actions. |
| Text     | No background, ideal for non-destructive actions. |
| Elevated | Subtle shadow for a visual elevation effect, perfect for prominent calls to action. |
| Tonal    | Background color matches the primary color of your application, emphasizing brand actions. |
| FAB      | Floating Action Button, a circular button typically used for a promoted action. |

### States

Buttons can have different states to provide visual feedback to users:

- **Hovered**: Adds a hover effect to the button.
- **Focused**: Highlights the button to indicate focus.
- **Activated**: Renders the button as active, typically when clicked.
- **Disabled**: Disables the button, preventing user interaction.

### IconButton

In addition to the primary button variants, Baka UI also provides an "IconButton" variant for situations where you need an icon as the primary element within a button. This is useful when you want to emphasize the visual representation of an action.

```jsx
import { BakaButton, BakaIcon } from "@baka/react";

// IconButton example:
<BakaButton variant="icon">
  <BakaIcon>settings</BakaIcon>
</BakaButton>
```

### FAB (Floating Action Button)

The "Floating Action Button" (FAB) is a circular button that typically represents a promoted action in your application. It stands out from other elements and is often used for primary actions.

#### Small FABs

Small FABs are suitable for situations where space is limited. They come in three primary variants: surface, primary, and secondary.

```jsx
import { BakaButton, BakaIcon } from "@baka/react";

// Small FAB examples:
<BakaButton variant={["fab", "small"]}>
  <BakaIcon>edit</BakaIcon>
</BakaButton>
<BakaButton variant={["fab", "small", "primary"]}>
  <BakaIcon>edit</BakaIcon>
</BakaButton>
<BakaButton variant={["fab", "small", "secondary"]}>
  <BakaIcon>edit</BakaIcon>
</BakaButton>
```

#### Medium FABs

Medium FABs are the default size and come in the same three primary variants: surface, primary, and secondary.

```jsx
import { BakaButton, BakaIcon } from "@baka/react";

// Medium FAB examples:
<BakaButton variant={"fab"}>
  <BakaIcon>edit</BakaIcon>
</BakaButton>
<BakaButton variant={["fab", "primary"]}>
  <BakaIcon>edit</BakaIcon>
</BakaButton>
<BakaButton variant={["fab", "secondary"]}>
  <BakaIcon>edit</BakaIcon>
</BakaButton>
```

#### Large FABs

Large FABs are suitable for situations where you want to make the FAB more prominent. They also come in the same three primary variants: surface, primary, and secondary.

```jsx
import { BakaButton, BakaIcon } from "@baka/react";

// Large FAB examples:
<BakaButton variant={["fab", "large"]}>
  <BakaIcon>edit</BakaIcon>
</BakaButton>
<BakaButton variant={["fab", "large", "primary"]}>
  <BakaIcon>edit</BakaIcon>
</BakaButton>
<BakaButton variant={["fab", "large", "secondary"]}>
  <BakaIcon>edit</BakaIcon>
</BakaButton>
```

#### Extended FABs

Extended FABs combine an icon and a label to provide more context about the action. They come in the same three primary variants: surface, primary, and secondary.

```jsx
import { BakaButton, BakaIcon } from "@baka/react";

// Extended FAB examples:
<BakaButton variant={["fab", "extended"]}>
  <BakaIcon>edit</BakaIcon>
  BakaLabel
</BakaButton>
<BakaButton variant={["fab", "extended", "primary"]}>
  <BakaIcon>edit</BakaIcon>
  BakaLabel
</BakaButton>
<BakaButton variant={["fab", "extended", "secondary"]}>
  <BakaIcon>edit</BakaIcon>
  BakaLabel
</BakaButton>
```

### Usage Guidelines

When choosing a button style for your application, consider the following guidelines:

- **Button Variants**: Select the appropriate button variant based on the action's importance and context within your application.
- **States**: Utilize the various button states (hovered, focused, activated) to provide visual feedback to users and enhance user experience.
- **Disabled Buttons**: Disable buttons when the associated action is unavailable or invalid to prevent user interaction.

## Real-World Examples

Here are some real-world examples of using different button variants in various contexts:

#### Form Submission

In a form, you can use a "filled" button for the "Submit" action to make it stand out as the primary action.

```jsx
<BakaButton variant="filled">Submit</BakaButton>
```

#### Secondary Action

For secondary actions, like canceling an operation, you can use an "outlined" button.

```jsx
<BakaButton variant="outlined">Cancel</BakaButton>
```

#### Non-Destructive Action

When you have a non-destructive action, such as "Read More," consider using a "text" button.

```jsx
<BakaButton variant="text">Read More</BakaButton>
```

#### Elevated Call to Action

An elevated button can be used for a prominent call to action, like "Sign Up Now."

```jsx
<BakaButton variant="elevated">Sign Up Now</BakaButton>
```

#### Brand Color Action

If you want to emphasize a brand color action, use a "tonal" button.

```jsx
<BakaButton variant="tonal">Learn More</BakaButton>
```

#### Floating Action Button (FAB)

Floating Action Buttons (FABs) are typically used for promoting a primary action within your application. They are available in small, medium, large, and extended sizes.

```jsx
<BakaButton variant={["fab", "small"]}>
  <BakaIcon>edit</BakaIcon>
</BakaButton>
<BakaButton variant={"fab"}>
  <BakaIcon>edit</BakaIcon>
</BakaButton>
```
