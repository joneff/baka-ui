# Typescript

The `baka-material-you` package distribute typing specific to the Material You Design Language.

## Usage

To enable the contextual types for the Material You Design Language:

1. Create an `design.d.ts` file.
1. Declare a module called `baka-core`:

```ts
declare module "baka-core" {}
```

1. Import the Material You Design types:

```ts
import { BakaDesignMaterialYou } from "baka-material-you/types/design";
```

1. Extend the `BakaDesign` interface with the Material You Design types:

```ts
export interface BakaDesign extends BakaDesignMaterialYou {}
```

You can further override the Material You Design types by adding additional properties to the `BakaDesign` interface.

Here's how the `design.d.ts` file should look like:

```ts
declare module "baka-core" {
  import { BakaDesignMaterialYou } from "baka-material-you/types/design";

  export interface BakaDesign extends BakaDesignMaterialYou {
    // Extend or override here
  }
}
```
