# Color System

The `baka-material-you` Color System implements the Material You Design System swatch. It creates a pair of `sass` and `css` variables for usage in your application.

## Usage

The `baka-material-you` package provides a set of `sass` mixins and variables for styling your application, the main ones being:

- `styles` - A mixin that applies all of the Material You Design System styles.
- `design--styles` - A mixin that applies only css variables for the corresponding theme.
- `component--styles` - A mixin that applies only styles for the components.

```scss
@use "baka-material-you" as material-you;

body {
  @include material-you.styles();
}
```

or alternatively:

```scss
@use "baka-material-you" as material-you;

@include material-you.component--styles();

:root {
  @include material-you.design-styles();
}
```

### Styling Components

You can utilize the `baka-material-you` Color System by importing the package and using the `$swatch` variable for any custom styles and components in your application.

```scss
@use "baka-material-you" as material-you;

.my-element {
  color: map-get(material-you.$swatch, on-surface);
  background-color: map-get(material-you.$swatch, surface);
}
```

This will result in the following CSS:

```css
.my-element {
  color: var(--on-surface, #1d1b20);
  background-color: var(--surface, #fef7ff);
}
```

### Styling Layout

By utilizing the [Baka Tailwind Preset](/desing/material-you/tailwind), you can easily style your layout with the `baka-material-you` Color System.

```html
<div class="bg-surface-container">Hello World</div>
```

## Theming

The `baka-material-you` Color System supports theming. You can change the theme by passing a new `swatch` variable.

```scss
@use "baka-material-you" as material-you;
@use "baka-material-you/themes/dark" as dark-swatch;

:root {
  @include materila-you.styles();

  @media screen and (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
    @include dark-swatch.design-styles();
  }
}
```

### Custom Theme

The `baka-material-you` Color System also supports custom theming. You can create a new theme by passing a custom `swatch` variable.

> The custom `swatch` will be merged with the default one.

```scss
$custom-swatch: (
  primary: #ff0000,
  secondary: #00ff00,
  surface: #000000,
  on-surface: #ffffff,
);

@use "baka-material-you" as material-you with (
  $swatch: $custom-swatch
);

.my-element {
  color: map-get(material-you.$swatch, on-surface);
  background-color: map-get(material-you.$swatch, surface);
}
```
