# Tailwind

The `baka-material-you` package distributes a tailwind preset, which allows you to be consistent across your whole application, regardless if you are styling a global layout or individual component.

## Usage

To enable the tailwind preset in your project, you need to add the following configuration to your `tailwind.config.js` file:

```js
module.exports = {
  // ...
  presets: [require("baka-material-you/tailwind")],
};
```

## Benefits

- **Consistency**: The tailwind preset ensures that you are using the same colors, typography, and spacing across your whole application.
- **Themeable**: The tailwind preset is based on the Material You color palette, which means that you can easily switch between light and dark themes.
- **Customizable**: You can still customize the tailwind configuration to fit your needs.
