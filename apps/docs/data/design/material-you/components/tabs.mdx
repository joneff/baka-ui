# Tabs

Tabs make it easy to explore and switch between different views. They allow users to quickly move between a small number of equally important sections of their application.

<Demo src="/demos/material-you/tabs" />

## Usage

```jsx
import { BakaTabGroup, BakaTab, BakaText } from "baka-ui";

function MyApp() {
  return (
    <BakaTabGroup>
      <BakaTab>
        <BakaText>Tab</BakaText>
      </BakaTab>
      <BakaTab>
        <BakaText>Tab</BakaText>
      </BakaTab>
    </BakaTabGroup>
  );
}
```

## Variants

The `BakaTabGroup` component supports two variants: `primary` and `secondary. Each variant could be also used with the `overflow` variant to allow horizontally scrollable tab group.

### Primary

The `primary` variant is destinguished by the coloring of all tab components in the `primary` color from the design system swatch. Additionally, it's constructive elements are positioned vertically.

### Secondary 

The `secondary` variant provides a subtler coloring of the tab components. It's constructive elements are positioned horizontally.
