## BakaTopBar

### Introduction

The "BakaTopBar" component is designed to create top navigation bars in your application. It provides a flexible and customizable way to handle top-level navigation, actions, and titles.

<Demo src="/demos/material-you/bars/top-bar" />

### Usage

To use the "BakaTopBar" component, simply import it from `baka-ui` and include it in your JSX code. Here's a basic example:

```jsx
import { BakaTopBar, BakaButton, BakaIcon } from "baka-ui";

// Inside your component:
<BakaTopBar>{/* Add buttons, text, or icons here */}</BakaTopBar>;
```

### Props

The following props can be used to customize the "BakaTopBar" component:

- `variant` (string or array of strings): Sets the variant of the top bar. Available options are "medium," "large," and "elevated." You can use an array for multiple variants.

- `style` (object): Allows you to apply custom CSS styles to the top bar.

- More props can be added based on your specific use case.

### Variants

#### Medium Variant

```jsx
<BakaTopBar variant="medium">{/* Components for the medium-sized top bar */}</BakaTopBar>
```

<Demo src="/demos/material-you/bars/top-bar/medium" />

Use the "medium" variant when you need a top bar that adapts well to medium-sized screens. It provides a balanced layout for elements within the bar.

#### Large Variant

```jsx
<BakaTopBar variant="large">{/* Components for the large top bar */}</BakaTopBar>
```

<Demo src="/demos/material-you/bars/top-bar/large" />

The "large" variant is suitable for top bars with complex content or when you have more screen real estate to work with. It offers a spacious layout for arranging components.

#### Elevated Variant

```jsx
<BakaTopBar variant="elevated">{/* Components for the elevated top bar */}</BakaTopBar>
```

<Demo src="/demos/material-you/bars/top-bar/elevated" />

If you want to emphasize the importance of the top bar in your interface, the "elevated" variant adds a subtle shadow to create a visual elevation effect.

#### Real-World Example

In an e-commerce website, you can utilize the "BakaTopBar" to display essential information like user account details and a search icon, while the "BakaBottomBar" can host navigation links to product categories, a shopping cart icon, and a "Checkout" button.

### BakaBottomBar

#### Introduction

The "BakaBottomBar" component serves as a bottom navigation bar within your application. It's ideal for displaying primary actions or navigation items.

<Demo src="/demos/material-you/bars/bottom-bar" />

#### Usage

To use the "BakaBottomBar" component, import it from `baka-ui` and add it to your JSX code. Here's a basic example:

```jsx
import { BakaBottomBar, BakaButton, BakaIcon } from "baka-ui";

// Inside your component:
<BakaBottomBar>{/* Add buttons or icons here */}</BakaBottomBar>;
```

#### Props

The "BakaBottomBar" component supports the following props:

- `style` (object): Apply custom CSS styles to the bottom bar.

- More props can be added to suit your needs.

#### Real-World Example

For a social media app, the "BakaTopBar" can feature the user's profile picture, notifications, and messaging icons, while the "BakaBottomBar" provides shortcuts to the user's feed, notifications, and profile pages.

## Usage Guidelines

When deciding whether to use the "BakaTopBar" or "BakaBottomBar" in your application, consider the following guidelines:

- **TopBar vs. BottomBar**: Use the "BakaTopBar" for top-level navigation and actions. On the other hand, the "BakaBottomBar" is more appropriate for primary bottom navigation.

- **Variants**: Select the appropriate variant (medium, large, or elevated) for your top bar based on your application's layout and design requirements.

- **Customization**: Customize the components further with additional CSS styles or by extending their functionality using props as needed.

## Real-World Examples

To provide a more practical context, let's explore some real-world examples of using both "BakaTopBar" and "BakaBottomBar" together in a single interface:

#### E-commerce Website

In an e-commerce website, you can utilize the "BakaTopBar" to display essential information like user account details and a search icon, while the "BakaBottomBar" can host navigation links to product categories, a shopping cart icon, and a "Checkout" button.

#### Social Media App

For a social media app, the "BakaTopBar" can feature the user's profile picture, notifications, and messaging icons, while the "BakaBottomBar" provides shortcuts to the user's feed, notifications, and profile pages.

These examples demonstrate how the "Bars" components can be effectively combined in different scenarios to enhance user experience and navigation within your web application.
