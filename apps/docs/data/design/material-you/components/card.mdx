# Card

The Card component is a versatile component for displaying content with a consistent and visually appealing design. It can be customized with different variants to match the style of your application.

<Demo src="/demos/material-you/card" style={{ height: 650 }} />

## Usage

To use the Card component, import it from `baka-ui`:

```tsx
import { BakaCard } from "baka-ui";
```

Then, you can create a Card with different variants and content as needed.

```tsx
<BakaCard variant={"outlined"}>{/* Content goes here */}</BakaCard>
```

### Variants

The Card component supports the following variants:

- `"outlined"`: A card with an outlined border.
- `"elevated"`: A card with elevated (raised) appearance.
- `"filled"`: A card with a filled background color.

You can also combine variants to create unique card styles, such as `"["outlined", "horizontal"]"` for an outlined horizontal card.

## Content

The content of a Card can be customized based on your needs. You can include text, images, buttons, and other components within the Card to display your content effectively.

### Example

```tsx
